## Picture Quality of 360° Images Compressed by Emerging Compression Algorithms

Repository offers results and data of objective quality assessment for compressed 360° images.

The data was used and presented in the article:
#### [Picture Quality of 360◦ Images Compressed by Emerging Compression Algorithms](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9764941)

## 
Data is stored separately for reference images:

Six reference images can be seen for illustration below:

According to the level of
compression, each image was compressed in a range of six
different Quantization Parameter (QP) settings. Considering
four compression algorithms, we obtained 24 compressed images per source image.

More information about parameters, image sources and compression software can be found in the mentioned conference article.
